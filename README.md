# Anderson Cancer Center Data Analysis Assignment

## Introduction
This repository contains Python code to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. The goal is to identify essential variables for securing donor funding and to optionally implement logistic regression for prediction.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

# pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`cancer_analysis.py`).
3. Run the script using Python:

# python cancer_analysis.py

## Results
- The script will perform PCA on the breast cancer dataset and reduce it into 2 PCA components.
- Optionally, logistic regression is implemented for prediction.
- The accuracy of the logistic regression model is displayed.
- A scatter plot of the PCA components is generated, showing the distribution of benign and malignant cases.

## Credits
This assignment is completed as part of the requirements for a Data Analyst role at the Anderson Cancer Center.
